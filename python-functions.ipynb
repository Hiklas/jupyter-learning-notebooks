    "If you have a dog sitter or friend looking after your pet you may even write these steps down.  In computing terms these set of steps would likely be encapsulated as a 'method' or 'function' (we'll cover the difference in those terms later); a task that can be re-used many times without having to write the code for every case where you need it.  You can declare the function once and then call it when needed, for example:\n",

    "## Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can take values which they can use to carry out their work.  A value that is passed to a method is called an argument or parameter, they are very similar to letters in algebra equations or variables in programming languages.  In fact, when you declare a method with arguments you are creating variables which will hold the values being passed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def printWithStars(stringToPrint):\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "printWithStars(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pass in multiple arguments, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def printGreeting(greeting, who):\n",
    "  print(\"I say \" + greeting + \" to \" + who)\n",
    "  \n",
    "printGreeting(\"hello\", \"the sunshine\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property for python arguments is that they are passed by reference.  This may not quite make sense yet but, in short, the things that variables hold are actually pointers to objects.  It's kind of like having a group of friends round for your birthday and each one points to the wrapped gift that they brought on the pile in front of you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that scenario you could have two friends who contributed to the same gift in which case they will be pointing at one present.  In much the same way lots of variables can all point at the same object.  This pointer is called a 'reference'.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that changes to a given object will be reflected outside of the function, for example run the following code to see what happens:"
