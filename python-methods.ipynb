In computing terms these set of steps would likely be encapsulated as a method; a task that can be re-used many times without having to write the code for every case where you need it.  You can declare the function once and then call it when needed, for example:\n",

A value that is passed to a method is called an argument or parameter, they are very similar to letters in algebra equations or variables in programming languages.
